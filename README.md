
# To Use

1. Read all instructions first
2. Clone the repo
3. Run

     sudo ./ccdc.sh # from the root directory

5. Choose from the menu:

    Comprehensive - Runs everything automatically
    Core Menu - Pick specific hardening tasks
    Web Menu - Web application hardening
    Continuous Menu - Security scanning

6. If an error occurs like a file or folder is missing for 'apache' or 'ssh' then you can add that missing file or directory and re-run the script.
7. Please note that if a service like 'ssh' or 'apache' is not installed, the 'comprehensive' option may fail. You can still run each hardening step manually and it doesn't take a lot of time to do.
