## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for employees to recognize, avoid, and report malware threats. Following a recent security incident where malware spread through our network, we are formalizing these requirements to prevent future infections and protect company systems and data.

All employees share responsibility for keeping our network secure. This policy explains what malware is, how it spreads, and what you must do to protect yourself and the organization.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All full-time and part-time employees
- Contractors and temporary workers
- Any individual granted access to company systems or networks

This policy covers all company-owned devices, personal devices used for work (BYOD), and any systems connected to the company network.

**Phishing** – Fraudulent emails or messages designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links.

**Social Engineering** – Manipulation techniques used to deceive people into breaking security procedures or divulging confidential information.

**Email Safety**

- Do not click links in emails unless you are certain of their legitimacy
- Report suspicious emails to IT immediately—do not forward them to coworkers

**Web Browsing**

- Only visit websites necessary for your job duties

- Allow automatic updates to run—do not postpone them indefinitely
- Lock your computer when leaving your desk
- Do not connect unknown USB drives or external devices to your computer

**Reporting**

- Do not attempt to remove malware yourself—contact IT

## 5. Organization's Responsibilities

The organization commits to providing:

**Technical Controls**

- Endpoint protection software on all company devices
- Email filtering to block known malicious attachments and links
- Web filtering to block access to known malicious websites
- Network monitoring to detect malware activity
- Regular patching and updates for all systems

**Training and Awareness**

- Clear reporting channels for security concerns
- Resources to help employees identify suspicious activity

**Incident Response**

## 6. Disciplinary Action

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action based on the severity and circumstances of the violation.

**Unintentional Violations** – Employees who inadvertently cause a malware infection despite following this policy will not face disciplinary action. Mistakes happen, and our goal is to learn from incidents, not punish employees who report problems.

**Negligent Violations** – Employees who disregard this policy (such as repeatedly opening suspicious attachments after training, or disabling security software) may face disciplinary action including written warning, additional mandatory training, or temporary restriction of system access.

**Intentional Violations** – Employees who deliberately introduce malware, disable security controls to circumvent policy, or fail to report known infections may face termination and potential legal action.

The decision on disciplinary measures will consider factors including the employee's history, whether they reported the incident promptly, the impact on the organization, and any mitigating circumstances.

---

## 7. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually by the Information Security Department and updated as needed to address new threats and changing business requirements.

Significant changes to the policy will be communicated to all employees, and updated training will be provided when necessary.

Employees may submit suggestions for policy improvements to the Information Security Department at any time.

**Next Scheduled Review:** January 2027
