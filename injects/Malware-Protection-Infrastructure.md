# BUSINESS MEMO

**TO:** Executive Management  
**FROM:** IT Security Team  
**DATE:** January 24, 2026  
**RE:** Malware Protection, Detection, and Mitigation Infrastructure

---

## Executive Summary

This memo describes the technical controls and policy/procedural elements currently in place to protect our organization from malware, detect malicious activity, and mitigate threats when discovered.

---

## Technical Controls - Currently Deployed

### 1. Centralized Logging (Splunk)

**What's In Place:**
- Splunk Enterprise server collecting logs from all infrastructure
- Universal Forwarders deployed on Linux and Windows systems
- Network device syslog forwarding configured
- Custom indexes for security events, authentication, network traffic

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Centralized visibility enables rapid detection of anomalies
- Correlation of events across systems identifies lateral movement
- Log retention provides forensic capability for incident investigation

### 2. File Integrity Monitoring

**What's In Place:**
- Custom integrity baseline and monitoring scripts deployed on Linux servers
- Monitors critical directories: `/etc`, `/root`, `/var/www`, `/opt`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/home`
- SHA256 hashing with permission, ownership, and timestamp tracking
- Automated cron job checks with syslog alerting
- Alerts for: modified files, permission changes, new files, deleted files

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Detects unauthorized modifications to system files and configurations
- Identifies new malicious files dropped by attackers
- Alerts on persistence mechanism installation

### 3. Network Connection Monitoring

**What's In Place:**
- Outbound SSH detection script monitoring for unauthorized SSH connections
- UDP beacon detection scripts for both Linux and Windows
- Process attribution for suspicious connections
- Syslog integration for centralized alerting

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Detects command-and-control (C2) beaconing activity
- Identifies malware propagation attempts (like SSH worm we discovered)
- Alerts on unauthorized outbound connections

### 4. Host-Based Firewall

**What's In Place:**
- UFW (Ubuntu) and firewalld (Fedora) configured on all Linux systems
- Windows Firewall with advanced security rules
- Default-deny outbound policy with explicit allow rules
- Service-specific port restrictions

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Limits lateral movement by blocking unnecessary ports
- Prevents data exfiltration to unauthorized destinations
- Contains compromised systems

### 5. Service Hardening

**What's In Place:**
- Disabled unnecessary services on all systems
- SSH hardening: key-based auth, no root login, protocol 2 only
- Web server hardening: ModSecurity, disabled directory listing
- Database hardening: localhost binding, strong authentication
- Removed default/test accounts

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Reduces attack surface
- Eliminates common exploitation vectors
- Prevents privilege escalation through misconfigured services

### 6. Fail2Ban Intrusion Prevention

**What's In Place:**
- Fail2ban deployed on Linux servers
- Monitors SSH, web, and mail authentication
- Automatic IP blocking after failed attempts
- Configurable ban duration and thresholds

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Prevents brute-force password attacks
- Blocks automated attack tools
- Reduces noise in security logs

### 7. System Hardening

**What's In Place:**
- Kernel hardening (sysctl parameters for network stack protection)
- File permission hardening on sensitive files
- Disabled SUID bits on unnecessary binaries
- User account restrictions and password policies

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Limits privilege escalation opportunities
- Protects against local exploits
- Reduces post-compromise capabilities

---

## Policy and Procedural Controls - Currently In Place

### 1. Incident Response Procedures

**What's In Place:**
- Documented incident response playbook
- Evidence collection scripts for forensics
- System isolation procedures
- Service restoration procedures
- Coordinated cleanup process for network-wide threats

**Demonstrated Effectiveness:**
- Successfully used during SSH malware incident
- Coordinated simultaneous cleanup across all affected systems
- Prevented malware re-propagation

### 2. Password Management Policy

**What's In Place:**
- Immediate password change on all systems upon deployment
- Ansible-automated password rotation capability
- Complex password requirements enforced
- Separate credentials per service/system

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Prevents credential reuse attacks
- Limits impact of credential theft
- Blocks brute-force attempts

### 3. Change Management

**What's In Place:**
- All configuration changes documented
- Scripts version-controlled in Git repository
- Peer review of significant changes
- Rollback capability for failed changes

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Prevents unauthorized changes
- Enables detection of malicious modifications
- Supports forensic investigation

### 4. Employee Security Awareness Policy

**What's In Place:**
- Information Security Best Practice Policy distributed
- Social engineering awareness training
- Acceptable use guidelines
- Incident reporting procedures

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Reduces human-factor vulnerabilities
- Enables early threat reporting
- Creates security-conscious culture

### 5. Startup File Auditing

**What's In Place:**
- Regular audit of systemd services, cron jobs, init scripts
- Documented checklist for Linux startup file locations
- Verified clean state on all systems after malware remediation

**Malware Protection Value:**
- Detects persistence mechanisms
- Identifies unauthorized scheduled tasks
- Ensures malware cannot survive reboot

## Recent Threat Response - Proof of Effectiveness

Our infrastructure successfully detected and remediated an active SSH-propagating malware (startup_check.py):

| Phase | Action | Control Used |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Detection | Identified suspicious Python process | Process monitoring |
| Analysis | Determined propagation method (SSH/Paramiko) | Log analysis, code review |
| Containment | Isolated affected systems | Firewall rules |
| Eradication | Coordinated removal across all systems | Incident response procedures |
| Recovery | Verified clean state, rotated credentials | Startup audit, password policy |

---

## Summary

Our defense-in-depth approach combines:
- **Prevention:** Hardening, firewalls, access controls
- **Detection:** Centralized logging, integrity monitoring, connection monitoring
- **Response:** Documented procedures, automation, forensic capability

These controls are actively deployed and have been validated through real incident response.
