# Incident Response Procedure
## Employee-Caused Malware Infection

**Effective Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Document Owner:** IT Security

---

### Purpose

This procedure outlines the steps to follow when an employee's workstation becomes infected with malware through web browsing or email. Based on our recent experience handling the SSH propagation malware, we've developed this standardized response process.

---

### Immediate Actions (First 15 Minutes)

When malware is suspected or confirmed on an employee workstation:

1. **Disconnect the machine from the network** - Unplug the ethernet cable or disable WiFi immediately. Do not shut down the computer yet, as this may destroy forensic evidence in memory.

2. **Document what the employee was doing** - Ask them what website they visited or what email attachment they opened. Get the URL or email subject line if possible. Write this down before they forget.

3. **Note any unusual behavior they observed** - Pop-ups, slow performance, strange error messages, unexpected programs running.

4. **Contact the security team lead** - Report the incident verbally first, then follow up in writing.

### Containment (15-60 Minutes)

5. **Check if the malware has spread** - Look for connections from the infected machine to other systems. Check network logs and run connection monitoring on nearby systems.

6. **Isolate any other affected machines** - If the malware propagates (like ours did via SSH), disconnect those systems too.

7. **Block the malware's communication** - If you identify a command-and-control server or propagation target, block it at the firewall.

8. **Preserve evidence** - Take screenshots of running processes, network connections, and any suspicious files. If possible, capture memory before shutting down.

### Investigation

9. **Identify the infection vector** - Determine exactly how the malware got in:
   - For web-based: Check browser history, download folder, temp files
   - For email-based: Preserve the original email, check if others received it

10. **Analyze the malware** - Determine what it does:
    - Does it steal credentials?
    - Does it spread to other machines?
    - Does it communicate externally?
    - Does it persist after reboot?

11. **Determine the scope** - Figure out what systems and data may have been affected. Check for the same indicators on other machines.

### Eradication

12. **Remove the malware from all affected systems** - If the malware spreads, clean all infected machines simultaneously to prevent reinfection. We learned this the hard way - cleaning one machine at a time lets the malware re-propagate from machines still infected.

13. **Remove persistence mechanisms** - Check and clean:
    - Scheduled tasks and cron jobs
    - Startup programs and services
    - Browser extensions
    - Registry run keys (Windows)

14. **Change compromised credentials** - If the malware could have captured passwords, reset them. Include both local and domain accounts the employee has access to.

---

### Recovery

15. **Verify the system is clean** - Run antivirus scans, check for indicators of compromise, monitor for suspicious behavior.

16. **Reconnect to the network** - Only after confirming the malware is gone.

17. **Monitor closely for 48 hours** - Watch for signs of reinfection or dormant malware activating.

---

### Post-Incident

18. **Document everything** - Write up what happened, how it was detected, what was affected, and how it was resolved.

19. **Counsel the employee** - Review what happened without blame. Reinforce security awareness training. This is a learning opportunity, not a punishment.

20. **Update defenses** - Block the malicious URL or email sender. Add detection signatures for this malware. Consider what controls could have prevented or detected this faster.

21. **Brief management** - Provide a summary of the incident and any recommendations for preventing similar incidents.

### Lessons From Our Recent Incident

During the SSH malware incident, we learned several things that informed this procedure:

- Malware that propagates requires coordinated cleanup across all systems at once
- Checking startup locations and scheduled tasks is critical for finding persistence
- Network connection monitoring detected the malware's beaconing behavior
- Having centralized logging made it possible to trace the malware's activity across systems
- Changing passwords after cleanup prevented the malware from using stolen credentials to return

This procedure incorporates those lessons so we respond more effectively next time.
