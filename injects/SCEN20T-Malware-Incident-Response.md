|---|---|
| **TO:** | Management / Incident Response Team |
| **FROM:** | Security Operations Team |
| **DATE:** | January 24, 2026 |
| **RE:** | Initial Response Plan – Malware Incident (SCEN20T) |

---

## Situation Summary

An employee has clicked on a malicious attachment from a phishing email, resulting in potential malware infection across the organization. The nature, payload, and extent of damage are currently unknown.

---

## Immediate Detection Actions

### 1. Identify Patient Zero
- Determine which user/workstation opened the malicious attachment
- Review email server logs for the malicious message
- Interview the affected user to establish timeline

### 2. Network Traffic Analysis
Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs for:
- Unusual outbound connections (potential C2 beacons)
- Large or unexpected data transfers (data exfiltration)
- Connections to known malicious IPs or domains
- DNS queries to suspicious domains

### 3. Endpoint Assessment
On suspected infected systems, check for:
- Anomalous running processes
- Unauthorized scheduled tasks and startup items
- Suspicious services or drivers
- Unexpected user accounts or privilege escalations
- Modified system files or new executables in temp directories

### 4. Centralized Log Review (Splunk)
Search for indicators including:
- Failed or unusual authentication attempts
- PowerShell or script execution with encoded commands
- File modifications in critical system directories
- Lateral movement indicators (RDP, SMB, WinRM connections)
- New service installations

---

## Containment Steps

### Immediate Actions

| Priority | Action | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Isolate affected systems** | Disconnect from network; do NOT power off (preserve memory for forensics) |
| 2 | **Block malicious indicators** | Add known bad IPs/domains/hashes to firewall and endpoint block lists |
| 3 | **Disable compromised accounts** | Prevent attacker from using stolen credentials |
| 4 | **Segment critical assets** | Increase network isolation around sensitive servers |

### Evidence Preservation

- Capture memory dumps from affected systems
- Create disk images before any remediation
- Export relevant logs from SIEM
- Document all actions taken with timestamps

### Credential Security

- Reset passwords for potentially compromised accounts
- Rotate service account credentials on affected systems
- Review and revoke suspicious active sessions
- Enable additional authentication controls if available

---

## Monitoring Enhancements

During the incident, increase monitoring for:

- [ ] Authentication anomalies across all systems
- [ ] New scheduled tasks or services
- [ ] Unusual process execution chains
- [ ] Outbound traffic to new destinations
- [ ] File integrity changes on critical systems
- [ ] Email forwarding rule changes

---

## Next Steps

1. **Await additional intelligence** – More information on malware nature/payload expected as competition progresses
2. **Continue active monitoring** – Maintain heightened alerting on all systems
3. **Prepare remediation plan** – Ready cleanup procedures once scope is fully understood
4. **Document findings** – Maintain detailed incident log for post-incident review
