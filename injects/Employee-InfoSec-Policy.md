## 6. Social Engineering Awareness

### 6.1 What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is the manipulation of people to gain unauthorized access to information or systems. Attackers exploit human nature—trust, helpfulness, fear, and curiosity—rather than technical vulnerabilities.

### 6.2 Common Social Engineering Attacks

#### Phishing
- Fraudulent emails appearing to be from legitimate sources
- Often create urgency or fear to prompt quick action
- May contain malicious links or attachments

**How to Protect Yourself:**
- Verify sender email addresses carefully
- Hover over links before clicking to see actual destination
- Never provide credentials via email
- When in doubt, contact the sender through a known, separate channel

#### Pretexting
- Attacker creates a fabricated scenario to obtain information
- May impersonate IT support, executives, or vendors

**How to Protect Yourself:**
- Verify identity through official channels
- Do not provide sensitive information to unsolicited callers
- Follow established procedures for information requests

#### Baiting
- Leaving infected USB drives or devices to be found and used
- Offering free downloads that contain malware

**How to Protect Yourself:**
- Never plug in unknown USB devices
- Only download software from approved sources
- Report found devices to IT Security

#### Tailgating/Piggybacking
- Following authorized personnel through secured doors

**How to Protect Yourself:**
- Never hold doors for unknown individuals
- Politely ask to see credentials
- Report suspicious access attempts

### 6.3 Reporting Social Engineering Attempts

Report all suspected social engineering attempts to the Information Security team immediately, even if you're unsure. Early reporting can prevent attacks on other employees.
